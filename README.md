# HTTP GET and POST protocols and httpc - a cURL like command line application

In this project, I implemented a library which contains functions to send HTTP GET and POST requests to servers. The functions utilize TCP sockets from the Node.js 'net' module to establish connections with servers. Later, I developed a cURL like command-line application called 'httpc' by using which, users can send GET and POST requests to servers. Some of the features of 'httpc' are:

  - Fetch data using GET
  - Post input data to server with POST
  - Post data from a file to server with POST
  - verbose option
  - help option

Here's a video showing how it works: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ykh68pjMZHTSpkbCKq2gCxwlItygxgP1/view?usp=sharing
