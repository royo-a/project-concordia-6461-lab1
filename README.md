# HTTP GET and POST protocols and cURL like command line application

In this project, I implemented a library containing the HTTP GET and POST methods using Node.js. I developed a cURL like command-line application which uses the library to process GET and POST requests. Some of the features of the client app are:
  - Fetch data using GET
  - Post input data to server with POST
  - Post data from a file to server with POST
  - verbose option
  - help option
